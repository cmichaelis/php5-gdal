** OGR
   We don't use OGRSFDriverRegistrar::OpenShared, to keep things simple.
   Hence, we don't use OGRDataSource::Release either.
   Same way as PosgreSQL PHP module. Explicit Open/Close.
   PHP app is responsible for it, and is trusted not to access
   layers/features/... belonging to a closed dataSource.
   Anyway, at the end of request, dataSources are closed.
