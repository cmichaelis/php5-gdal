php5-gdal is a PHP 5 module that provides PHP bindings to the GDAL/OGR library.
It was written and is maintained by the Geonef company, http://www.geonef.fr/.

This package is released under the GNU Public License, version 3. See LICENSE file.

The build requires GDAL 1.7 or above.


This module is INCOMPLETE : roughly only half of the OGR library is supported and very few classes of GDAL. Adding bindings is a bit repetitive, not so difficult, so feel free to add the ones you need.

This module is UNSTABLE. Don't use it on production environment as it is.

The source is hosted on GitHub : https://github.com/geonef/php5-gdal
It was added recently and basic documentation is yet to be written.
